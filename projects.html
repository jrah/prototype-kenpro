    <div class="pt4">
      <p>As an example we are developing a multi-purpose fuel handling facility in Mombasa, Kenya for import, export and storage of  LNG, Crude Oil and refined Fuel to support the Government’s vision to supply cleaner, affordable energy to the country and also to export more resources internationally. The proposed project site is strategically located in Port Reitz, Mombasa - a very important entry / exit point for the whole region of East Africa. The facilities include Storage, LNG import, Pipelines and will also include an Independent Power Plant to support the Terminal infrastructure and surrounding commercial ventures.</p>
      <p>We are looking for international partners to join us in developing this exciting, ‘first-of-a-kind’ strategically important opportunity for Kenya and East Africa.</p>
